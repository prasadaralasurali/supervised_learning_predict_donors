# Finding Donors for CharityML Using Supervised Learning Techniques

## Project Overview
In this project, supervised learning techniques are used on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

The project include;
- Data preprocessing
- Establishing a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- Trying several supervised learning algorithms to see which one works best.
- Investigating whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

## Software Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
